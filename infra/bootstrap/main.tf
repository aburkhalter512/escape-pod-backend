# Bootstraps the S3 bucket + DynamoDB table that ../ (the main config)
# uses as its remote state backend. This has to be a separate config with
# its own local state — the main config can't use an S3 backend that
# doesn't exist yet. Apply this once, by hand, before ever running `tofu
# init` in ../. See ../README.md for the full two-step process.
